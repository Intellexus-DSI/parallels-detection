Japan’s conservative Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi swept to a landslide victory in a snap election on Sunday, marking a historic turnaround for her party, which had been hemorrhaging voter support in recent years — until she stepped to the helm.

Since she was elected more than four months ago – becoming Japan’s first female leader in a country where men have long dominated politics – Takaichi has enjoyed sky high approval ratings and a glowing endorsement from US President Donald Trump.

She won over many voters with her notoriously strong work ethic, savvy social media game and charisma, marked in viral moments such as a recent impromptu drum session with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung – stoking public enthusiasm to levels not seen since former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

It was a gamble to call a snap election. But Takaichi hoped to translate her own popularity into a stronger mandate for her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) – which has been weakened in recent years by a scandal involving the misuse of political funds.

Her risky move paid off. The LDP won more than 310 of the 465 seats in Japan’s lower house of parliament, marking the first time since World War II that a single party has secured a two-thirds majority. The broader ruling coalition won more than 340 seats.

Crucially, the two-thirds supermajority in the lower house will allow Takaichi’s party to override votes in the upper house of parliament and to propose amendments to the constitution.
