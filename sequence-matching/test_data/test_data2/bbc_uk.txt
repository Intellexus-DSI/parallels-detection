Cabinet ministers have rallied around Sir Keir Starmer after Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called on the prime minister to quit.

In a dramatic press conference, Sarwar said the situation in Downing Street was "not good enough" and that "too many mistakes" had been made at the top of government.

However, just as Sarwar began to speak, a flurry of senior Labour ministers took to social media to express their support for the prime minister.

Sir Keir continues fighting to shore up his position, after his judgement was questioned over the appointment of Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US, despite his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Breakfast the party had "looked over the precipice" on Monday but "thought the right thing to do was to support our leader".

Miliband - a former Labour leader - said Sir Keir had faced "a moment of peril" but that cabinet ministers had collectively "looked at the alternatives of going down this road of a chaotic leadership election, trying to depose a prime minister, and they said that's not for us".

On Monday evening, the prime minister addressed a packed meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party in the Houses of Parliament, where he was greeted with applause from his MPs.

The prime minister said he would not be stepping down, telling the gathering: "Every fight I've been in, I have won."

He said: "I have had my detractors every step along the way, and I've got them now.

"But I'll tell you this, after having fought so hard for the chance to change our country, I'm not prepared to walk away from my mandate and my responsibility to my country, or to plunge us into chaos, as others have done."

Speaking immediately after the meeting, former minister Justin Madders said he wanted to "hear more of what we heard tonight" from the PM.

"I don't think there was any sense in that room that night that people want a change in prime minister," he said.

However several sources inside the room told the BBC there were a number of critical questions from MPs.

"Several of my colleague were very forthright," one Labour MP told the BBC as they left the room.

At the same time as the PM was addressing MPs, Health Secretary Wes Streeting - who has been touted as a possible leadership rival to Sir Keir - took the unusual step of publishing some of the messages between himself and Lord Mandelson, a move he said was aimed at dispelling a "weekend of smear and innuendo that I have something to hide".

"Contrary to what has been widely reported, I was not a close friend of Peter Mandelson, but I am not going to wash my hands of my actual association with him either," Streeting wrote in the Guardian.

The messages include Streeting criticising the government for having "no [economic] growth strategy".
